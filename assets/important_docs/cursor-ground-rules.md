## Ground Rules Established
Throughout this refactoring process, the following ground rules were strictly followed:

1. **No Code Without Permission**: The assistant never produced code without explicit user approval
2. **Always Confirm Before Action**: Every major change was confirmed with the user before implementation
3. **No New Functionality to Existing Methods**: The refactoring focused purely on architectural changes, not feature additions
4. **No Functionality Removal for Existing Methods**: Existing functionality was preserved, only restructured
5. **No Enhancements to Existing Methods**: The goal was straightforward refactoring, not "fancification"
6. **Incremental Progress**: Each step was completed and verified before moving to the next
7. **Traditional Hexagonal Architecture**: Maintained classic ports & adapters pattern without vertical slicing
8. **Layer-by-Layer Approach**: Systematically tackled each architectural layer before proceeding
9. **Consistency Across Services**: All application services must follow the same architectural patterns
10. **Proper Type Handling**: Repository layer returns `Result<T, E>`, Application layer converts to `AppResult<T>`
11. **Version Alignment**: Ensure dependency versions are aligned (e.g., `@carbonteq/fp` version compatibility)
12. **Functional Error Handling**: Use `matchRes` for handling `Result<T, E>` types at application boundaries
