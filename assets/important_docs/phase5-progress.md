# Phase 5 Refactoring Progress: Resilience & Scalability

## Overview
This document tracks the complete progress of Phase 5 refactoring, implementing resilience patterns, multiple document stores, observability, and CLI tools to make the system enterprise-ready and scalable.

## Ground Rules Established
Throughout this refactoring process, the following ground rules were strictly followed:

1. **No Code Without Permission**: The assistant never produced code without explicit user approval
2. **Always Confirm Before Action**: Every major change was confirmed with the user before implementation
3. **No New Functionality to Existing Methods**: The refactoring focused purely on architectural changes, not feature additions
4. **No Functionality Removal for Existing Methods**: Existing functionality was preserved, only restructured
5. **No Enhancements to Existing Methods**: The goal was straightforward refactoring, not "fancification"
6. **Incremental Progress**: Each step was completed and verified before moving to the next
7. **Traditional Hexagonal Architecture**: Maintained classic ports & adapters pattern without vertical slicing
8. **Layer-by-Layer Approach**: Systematically tackled each architectural layer before proceeding
9. **Consistency Across Services**: All application services must follow the same architectural patterns
10. **Proper Type Handling**: Repository layer returns `Result<T, E>`, Application layer converts to `AppResult<T>`
11. **Version Alignment**: Ensure dependency versions are aligned (e.g., `@carbonteq/fp` version compatibility)
12. **Functional Error Handling**: Use `matchRes` for handling `Result<T, E>` types at application boundaries

### Phase 5 Specific Ground Rules
13. **Resilience First**: All new implementations must prioritize system resilience and graceful degradation
14. **Emulator Support**: Cloud storage strategies must support local emulators for development/testing
15. **Performance Monitoring**: All new features must integrate with observability and APM systems
16. **Backward Compatibility**: New storage strategies must not break existing local file operations
17. **Configuration Driven**: Storage strategy selection must be configurable via environment variables
18. **Health Monitoring**: All storage backends must provide comprehensive health metrics
19. **Error Handling**: All storage operations must handle failures gracefully with proper fallbacks
20. **CLI Integration**: CLI tools must integrate seamlessly with existing hexagonal architecture

## Phase 5 Objectives

### **Primary Goals**
1. **Resilience**: Implement retry patterns, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation
2. **Scalability**: Support multiple document stores with strategy pattern
3. **Observability**: Integrate New Relic for application performance monitoring
4. **CLI Tools**: Create bulk download CLI for data management

### **Principles at Play**
- **Being Resilient**: Systems work with failure, not against it
- **Scalable Applications**: Distributed system friendly, stateless, developer friendly
- **Observability**: Performance monitoring and error tracking

### **Expected Outcomes**
- Correct use of retry and timeouts for resilience
- Adding concurrency constraints on background processes
- Use New Relic to observe application performance
